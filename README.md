### APPROACH TO SOLUTION
##### SYNCING WITH GOOGLE MAPS, ACCUWEATHER AND USING INBUILT BAROMETRIC SENSORS 
Sending alert messages in high frequency whenever there is an accuweather prediction of thunderstorm, hurricane, tornado, etc. The app would also map sudden pressure and temperature changes to predict the chances of cyclones. Whenever there is precipitation in the mountanious region, the app will show the landslide prone routes. The syncing of Google Maps will be helpful to send messages to everyone driving in the route where landslide has occured. This will allow a part of the traffic to return back.

##### ALERT SYSTEM WITH CLOUD DATABASE
The app will have a cloud database with the update of the water level of every dam in the country. Whenever there is a an abnormal increase in the water level, high alert messages for chances of flood will be sent along with computer generated calls( for non-smartphone users )  to people who come in the path of that river. Tsunami and storm alerts will also be sent in a similar way.
##### VOLUNTEER GROUPS 
Whenever there is a natural disaster, link will be send to people. Small volunteer groups of 5-7 people will be created with autoselection on the basis of the closest distance. Whatsapp groups will be made with these people, the local authority and the app administrators to collect detailed information from the ground and help people.
##### EMERGENCY OPTION & SPECIAL DISASTER MODE
There will be an emergency option to send location to the three nearest volunteers, local authority and the army's rescue team and to block all other activities of phone to prevent battery draianage. This will increase the probability of the person to be rescued.
##### COLLECTION OF FUNDS AND RESOURCES
The app will be linked with BHIM, Paytm and Tez accounts to raise money for the victims of natural disasters. Moreover the volunteer groups can be used to pool resources from their nearby areas and provide it to the people in need.
##### HEALTH DATA
Volunteers, common people and the health authorities will be asked to report each and every incidences of diseases like diarrhoea. A database of such incidences will be created along with the location. If the number of such victims increases in a particular area, a red alert will be generated to prevent an epidemic.
